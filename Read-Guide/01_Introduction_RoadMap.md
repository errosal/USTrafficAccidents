**Introduction**

In this project, we will analyze U.S. traffic accident data to uncover patterns and trends that could help reduce accident rates and improve road safety.  
the dataset covers accidents from january 2016 to march 2023 and includes information on accident severity, location, time, weather conditions, and more. this dataset was retrieved from **Kaggle**, a popular data science community platform.

The primary goals of this analysis are:

- **To identify** accident trends over time, by location, and by severity.  
- **To understand** how external factors like weather and holidays affect accidents.  
- **To provide** actionable insights for policymakers and drivers.  

This is a roadmap of the notebooks and questions we are going to explore:

**1. Project Setup and Data Understanding**  
 
- How many features (columns) and accidents (rows) are recorded in the dataset?

**2.  Exploratory and Geographic Analysis**  

- How many accidents occurred in the datasetâ€™s time range?
- What is the trend in accidents over the years? Are accidents increasing or decreasing over time?
- What is the distribution of accidents across different months? Are there seasonal trends?
- At what time of day do most accidents happen (morning, afternoon, or night)?
- Which states had the highest and lowest number of accidents?
- Which cities have the highest and lower number of accidents?
- Which regions or states have the highest accident severity, and what factors contribute to more serious accidents in these areas?
- Generate a cluster map that groups areas with high and low accident concentrations across the U.S.


**3. Temporal and Severity Analysis**  

- What are the peak hours for accidents?
- Is there a pattern of accidents during rush hours (morning and evening)?
- How do accidents change over the course of a year?
- What is the distribution of accidents by severity levels (minor, moderate, severe, fatal)?
- What factors (e.g., weather, road conditions, time of day) seem to correlate with higher accident severity?

**4. External Factors and Key Locations**  
- How does weather affect accident rates?
- Do accidents increase during specific holidays or weekends?
- Can you visualize the top 10 most dangerous intersections or streets in the U.S.?


**5. Conclusions**
