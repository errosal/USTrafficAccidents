Introduction

<small>In this project, we will analyze U.S. traffic accident data to uncover patterns and trends that could help reduce accident rates and improve road safety.  
The dataset covers accidents from January 2016 to March 2023 and includes information on accident severity, location, time, weather conditions, and more. This dataset was retrieved from **Kaggle**, a popular data science community platform.</small>

The primary goals of this analysis are:

<small>
- To identify accident trends over time, by location, and by severity.
- To understand how external factors like weather and holidays affect accidents.
- To provide actionable insights for policymakers and drivers.
