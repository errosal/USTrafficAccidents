This is a roadmap of the Notebooks and questions we are going to explore:

	1.	General Accident Statistics
	•	How many accidents occurred in the dataset’s time range?
	•	What is the trend in accidents over the years? Are accidents increasing or decreasing over time?
	•	Which states had the highest and lowest number of accidents?
	•	What is the distribution of accidents across different months? Are there seasonal trends?
	•	Which days of the week are most accidents likely to occur?
	•	At what time of day do most accidents happen (morning, afternoon, or night)?
	2.	Geographic Analysis
	•	Which cities have the highest number of accidents?
	•	Which regions or states have the highest accident severity?
	•	Create a heat map that visualizes the density of accidents across the U.S.
	3.	Time and Temporal Trends
	•	What are the peak hours for accidents?
	•	Is there a pattern of accidents during rush hours (morning and evening)?
	•	How do accidents change over the course of a year?
	4.	Accident Severity and Outcomes
	•	What is the distribution of accidents by severity levels (minor, moderate, severe, fatal)?
	•	What factors (e.g., weather, road conditions, time of day) seem to correlate with higher accident severity?
	5.	Weather, Road Conditions, and External Factors
	•	How does weather affect accident rates?
	•	Do accidents increase during specific holidays or weekends?
	6.	Accident Causes
	•	What are the most common causes of accidents? (based on available description data)
	•	Are there correlations between traffic signals and accidents? (based on the “Traffic_Signal” field)
	7.	Accident Involvement by Road and Traffic Conditions
	•	Which road conditions (dry, wet, etc.) result in the highest number of accidents?
	8.	Visualization-Focused Questions
	•	Can you visualize the top 10 most dangerous intersections or streets in the U.S.?
	•	How does the severity of accidents differ when mapped geographically?
	•	Can you create an interactive dashboard that lets users filter accident data by state, year, and severity?
	9.	Comparison with Historical Data
	•	How have accident rates and patterns changed over time?
