# Introduction

In this project, we will analyze u.s. traffic accident data to uncover patterns and trends that could help reduce accident rates and improve road safety.  
the dataset covers accidents from january 2016 to march 2023 and includes information on accident severity, location, time, weather conditions, and more. this dataset was retrieved from **Kaggle**, a popular data science community platform.

the primary goals of this analysis are:

- **to identify** accident trends over time, by location, and by severity.  
- **to understand** how external factors like weather and holidays affect accidents.  
- **to provide** actionable insights for policymakers and drivers.  

this is a roadmap of the notebooks and questions we are going to explore:

1. general accident statistics  
   - how many accidents occurred in the dataset’s time range?  
   - what is the trend in accidents over the years? are accidents increasing or decreasing over time?  
   - which states had the highest and lowest number of accidents?  
   - what is the distribution of accidents across different months? are there seasonal trends?  
   - which days of the week are most accidents likely to occur?  
   - at what time of day do most accidents happen (morning, afternoon, or night)?  

2. geographic analysis  
   - which cities have the highest number of accidents?  
   - which regions or states have the highest accident severity?  
   - create a heat map that visualizes the density of accidents across the u.s.  

3. time and temporal trends  
   - what are the peak hours for accidents?  
   - is there a pattern of accidents during rush hours (morning and evening)?  
   - how do accidents change over the course of a year?  

4. accident severity and outcomes  
   - what is the distribution of accidents by severity levels (minor, moderate, severe, fatal)?  
   - what factors (e.g., weather, road conditions, time of day) seem to correlate with higher accident severity?  

5. weather, road conditions, and external factors  
   - how does weather affect accident rates?  
   - do accidents increase during specific holidays or weekends?  

6. accident causes  
   - what are the most common causes of accidents? (based on available description data)  
   - are there correlations between traffic signals and accidents? (based on the “traffic_signal” field)  

7. accident involvement by road and traffic conditions  
   - which road conditions (dry, wet, etc.) result in the highest number of accidents?  

8. visualization-focused questions  
   - can you visualize the top 10 most dangerous intersections or streets in the u.s.?  
   - how does the severity of accidents differ when mapped geographically?  
   - can you create an interactive dashboard that lets users filter accident data by state, year, and severity?  

9. comparison with historical data  
   - how have accident rates and patterns changed over time?
